Encapsulation

1. Task Description
   The main goal is to create a Java class named `Patient` with three fields: `id`, `name`, and `ssn`. The `id` field should be numeric, while the `name` and `ssn` fields should be strings.

The class should follow the principles of encapsulation, making the fields private and providing getter and setter methods to access and modify them.

2. Steps
Patient Class
   - Define the `Patient` class with three private fields: `id` (integer), `name`(String), and `ssn` (String).
   - Provide getter methods for each field to allow access to their values.
   - Implement setter methods for each field to enable modification of their values.

Test Class
   - Create a separate class named `Test`, which will serve as a test driver to demonstrate the functionality of the `Patient` class.
   - Within the `Test` class, include the `main` method, which serves as the entry point of the program.
`main` method
     - A new `Patient` object is created using new Patient()
     - The setter methods are used to initialize the `id`, `name`, and `ssn` properties of the `patient` object to new values as given below in Expected Output section.
     - The getter methods are used to retrieve `id`, `name`, and `ssn` properties of the `patient` object. Display same using `System.out.println` as shown below.

5. Expected Output:
Id: 123
Name: Bharath
SSN: 1234567890
