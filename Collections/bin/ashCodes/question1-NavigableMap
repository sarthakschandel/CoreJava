Navigable Map
The Exercise is to understand NavigableMap and use its methods.

1. Definition of NavigableMap:
   - NavigableMap is a child interface of SortedMap.
   - It is implemented by TreeMap.
   - NavigableMap provides various useful methods that work on the map's keys and entries.

2. Key and Value Data Type:
   - The map being created has both keys and values as strings.
   - Alphabets are used as keys, and corresponding values are arbitrary strings.

3. Methods Demonstrated:
   - `floorKey`: Finds the greatest key less than or equal to the given key.
   - `lowerKey`: Finds the greatest key strictly less than the given key.
   - `ceilingKey`: Finds the smallest key greater than or equal to the given key.
   - `higherKey`: Finds the smallest key strictly greater than the given key.
   - `pollFirstEntry`: Retrieves and removes the first entry from the map.
   - `pollLastEntry`: Retrieves and removes the last entry from the map.
   - `descendingMap`: Returns the map in descending order based on the keys.

4. Create a TreeMap:
   - The provided example creates a TreeMap with the following key-value pairs.Use the following method and print their results floorKey, lowerKey, ceilingKey, higherKey, pollFirstEntry, descendingMap
     A => Apple
     B => Boy
     C => Cat
     D => Dog

5. Execution and Expected Output:
C
A
D
B
A=Apple
{D=Dog, C=Cat, B=Boy}
